# Self-supervised edge features for improved Graph Neural Network training

Data availability:
[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cJ-wfKJ16yrqxQ4AoW0Tcid5t789sqbi?usp=sharing) is a link to the raw data for the organoids dataset. The raw COVID-19 patients dataset can be found on GEO ([GSE145926](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145926)). The pre-processed data (with the train/test/val splits we used in the paper) can be found here as pickle files. Unfortunately, I made the inadvertent error of storing the feature names in the pkl files as numbers so you need attached names, which are ordered the same as the numbers in the data pkl files for the key 'feat_names' key, to go from numbers to gene names (see two attached files).
